## Motivation

This is created because everybody likes board games. The design was inspired by Immutable Programming - Writing Functional Python by Calen Pennington. The [PyCon page](https://us.pycon.org/2017/schedule/presentation/729/) and the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OLEVvjrIj8).
